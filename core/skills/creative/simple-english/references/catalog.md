## THE RULE CATALOG

53 rules in 9 sections, paraphrased from ASD-STE100 Issue 9 with software examples. The official wording is in the free standard at asd-ste100.org.

### Section 1 — Words (Rules 1.1-1.14)

| Rule | Instruction |
|---|---|
| 1.1 | Use only approved words, technical nouns, or technical verbs. |
| 1.2 | Use an approved word only as its listed part of speech. |
| 1.3 | Use an approved word only with its approved meaning. |
| 1.4 | Use only the approved forms of verbs and adjectives. |
| 1.5 | You can use domain words as technical nouns ("webhook", "commit", "endpoint"). |
| 1.6 | Use an unapproved word only when it is a technical noun or part of one. |
| 1.7 | Do not use technical nouns as verbs. |
| 1.8 | Use the technical nouns of your project or industry. |
| 1.9 | When you pick a technical noun, pick a short and clear one. |
| 1.10 | No regional, slang, or jargon words as technical nouns. |
| 1.11 | One item, one name. Do not call it "config" here and "settings" there. |
| 1.12 | You can use domain verbs as technical verbs ("deploy", "compile", "merge"). |
| 1.13 | Do not use technical verbs as nouns. |
| 1.14 | Use American English spelling. |

In pragmatic mode, rules 1.5, 1.8, and 1.12 do the heavy lifting: your domain vocabulary is legal. The ones agents break are 1.7, 1.11, and 1.13.

**Before:** You can webhook the event, then do a deploy.
**After:** Send the event to the webhook. Then deploy the service.

### Section 2 — Multi-word nouns (Rules 2.1-2.2)

| Rule | Instruction |
|---|---|
| 2.1 | Write multi-word nouns of three words or fewer. |
| 2.2 | When a technical noun needs more than three words, write it in full once, then give a short form or hyphenate the units. |

Break long noun chains with prepositions (of, on, in, for):

**Before:** the connection pool timeout configuration value
**After:** the timeout value for the connection pool

### Section 3 — Verbs (Rules 3.1-3.7)

| Rule | Instruction |
|---|---|
| 3.1 | Use only the verb forms that the dictionary gives. |
| 3.2 | Use only: infinitive, imperative, simple present, simple past, simple future, past participle as adjective. |
| 3.3 | Use the past participle only as an adjective ("the cached response"). |
| 3.4 | No auxiliary verbs for complex constructions. No present perfect, no "is to be installed". |
| 3.5 | Use an "-ing" form only as a technical noun or inside one ("logging", "the mounting bracket") — never as a verb. |
| 3.6 | Active voice. In descriptive text, passive is legal only when the agent is unknown. |
| 3.7 | Describe an action with a verb, not a noun ("compress the file", not "perform compression of the file"). |

**Approved modals: can, will, must. Banned: should, would, may, might, could (Rule 3.2).**
The standard rejects "could" even for possibility: write "an explosion can occur", never "could occur". For "should": a requirement becomes "must"; a suggestion is stated as fact or deleted. This matters double for agent instructions — models read "should" as optional.

**Before:** The migration has completed and the table is being rebuilt.
**After:** The migration is complete. The database rebuilds the table.

**Before:** The flag can be set in the config file, making restarts unnecessary.
**After:** You can set the flag in the config file. Then a restart is not necessary.

**Before:** The temperature must be adjusted.
**After:** Adjust the temperature.

### Section 4 — Sentences (Rules 4.1-4.5)

| Rule | Instruction |
|---|---|
| 4.1 | Write short and clear sentences. |
| 4.2 | Do not omit words or use contractions to shorten sentences. Keep articles, keep "that". |
| 4.3 | Use a vertical list for complex text. |
| 4.4 | Use connecting words between sentences on related topics ("Then", "As a result"). |
| 4.5 | Put an article (the, a, an) or a demonstrative adjective (this, these) before nouns where applicable. |

Rule 4.2 is the anti-terseness rule. STE is short sentences with complete grammar, not telegraph style:

**Wrong shortening:** Ensure file exists before running.
**STE:** Make sure that the file exists before you run the command.

### Section 5 — Procedural writing (Rules 5.1-5.5)

| Rule | Instruction |
|---|---|
| 5.1 | Maximum 20 words per sentence. Warnings and cautions included. |
| 5.2 | One instruction per sentence, unless two actions happen at the same time. |
| 5.3 | Write instructions in the imperative: "Run the migration." |
| 5.4 | Put a required condition before the command, divided by a comma: "If the build fails, read the log." |
| 5.5 | Notes give information, never instructions. Notes get the 25-word limit. |

**Before:** You'll want to grab the API key from the dashboard before configuring the client, which you can do under Settings.
**After:** Get the API key from the dashboard, under Settings. Then configure the client with this key.

### Section 6 — Descriptive writing (Rules 6.1-6.6)

| Rule | Instruction |
|---|---|
| 6.1 | Give information gradually: one new fact per sentence. |
| 6.2 | Use key words and phrases to give the text a logical structure. |
| 6.3 | Maximum 25 words per sentence. |
| 6.4 | Group related information in paragraphs. |
| 6.5 | One topic per paragraph. |
| 6.6 | Maximum six sentences per paragraph. |

No imperative in descriptive text. Descriptions explain; procedures instruct.

### Section 7 — Safety instructions (Rules 7.1-7.3)

| Rule | Instruction |
|---|---|
| 7.1 | Use a word that shows the risk level ("WARNING" = injury, "CAUTION" = damage). |
| 7.2 | Start with a clear command or condition. |
| 7.3 | Then give the risk or the possible result. |

Never bury the instruction after the explanation. The pattern transfers directly to destructive CLI flags, irreversible migrations, and dangerous API options.

**Before:** Note that data loss may occur in some circumstances if the destructive flag happens to be enabled when running against production.
**After:** CAUTION: Do not use the `--force` flag against production. The flag deletes rows that do not match the source.

### Section 8 — Punctuation and word count (Rules 8.1-8.7)

| Rule | Instruction |
|---|---|
| 8.1 | All standard punctuation is legal except the semicolon. Write two sentences instead. |
| 8.2 | Use hyphens to connect words that act as one unit. |
| 8.3 | Parentheses are legal for references, item numbers, abbreviations, plural forms, explanations, alternatives. |
| 8.4 | In a vertical list, the lead-in colon ends a sentence for word count. |
| 8.5 | Text inside parentheses counts as one word. |
| 8.6 | Count as one word each: numbers, numbers with units, abbreviations, alphanumeric identifiers, quoted text, titles, labels, proper nouns. |
| 8.7 | A hyphenated word counts as one word. |

Rule 8.6 matters for software text: `sqlpipe run --config sqlpipe.yaml` in backticks is quoted text and counts as one word. Long identifiers do not blow your sentence budget.

### Section 9 — Writing practices (Rules 9.1-9.4, GR-1 to GR-8)

| Rule | Instruction |
|---|---|
| 9.1 | When a word-for-word replacement does not work, restructure the sentence. |
| 9.2 | Use each approved word correctly: approved meaning, approved part of speech. |
| 9.3 | Do not build phrasal verbs ("go down" → "decrease", "set up" → "install" or "configure"). |
| 9.4 | Keep one consistent style and terminology through the whole document. |

General recommendations GR-1 to GR-8: keep the conjunction "that", be careful with "with", give pronouns clear referents, prefer "this + noun" over bare "this", avoid false friends, avoid Latin abbreviations, use inclusive language, and use the possessive apostrophe form only when you are sure it is correct (GR-8: if unsure, do not use it — non-native readers find it hard).

GR-6 for software docs: "e.g." → "for example", "i.e." → "that is", and delete "etc." — name the items or write "and more".

## VOCABULARY DISCIPLINE

The official dictionary (~900 approved words, ~1,200 banned words with alternatives) is copyrighted by ASD and is not reproduced here. Its mechanics apply without it: **one word, one meaning, one part of speech.**

Known part-of-speech rulings, useful as patterns:

| Word | Ruling |
|---|---|
| test, check, work | Noun only. "Do a test", not "test the pump". "Check that X" becomes "make sure that X". |
| oil | Technical noun (TN) only. For the verb, the dictionary gives "lubricate": "Lubricate the linkage with oil." |
| help | Verb only. For the noun, the dictionary gives "aid": "with the aid of". |
| fall (noun) | Rejected. Use "decrease" for a reduction in value. Use FALL (verb) only for physical movement downward by gravity: "Make sure that the tools do not fall into the engine." |
| follow | "To come after" only, never "obey". Write "obey the instructions". |
| above, below | Physical positions only. For limits write "more than", "less than". |

### The modal ladder

| You wrote | STE writes |
|---|---|
| should (requirement) | must |
| should (recommendation) | Delete it, or state it as fact: "X is better because Y." |
| may / might / could (possibility) | can |
| may (permission) | can |
| would (hypothetical) | Restructure: "If X occurs, Y occurs." |

### Slop-to-simple substitutions

This table is ours, not the ASD dictionary. It maps the words AI-generated docs overuse to plain replacements. If the word carries no fact, delete it instead of replacing it.

| Slop | Write instead |
|---|---|
| leverage, utilize | use |
| in order to | to |
| prior to | before |
| ensure | make sure that (strict mode; in pragmatic mode, ensure is an allowed pick if it is your one chosen check-verb) |
| it is worth noting that | (delete) |
| it's important to, crucially | (delete — state the fact) |
| simply, just, easily, seamlessly, effortlessly | (delete) |
| robust, powerful, comprehensive, performant | (delete, or give the measurable property) |
| functionality | function, feature |
| enables you to, allows you to | you can |
| is designed to, aims to | (delete — say what it does) |
| facilitate | help, make possible |
| dive into, delve into | read, examine |
| when it comes to | for |
| in the event that | if |
| due to the fact that | because |
| as needed, as necessary | (state the condition) |
| and/or | Pick one, or write "X, or Y, or both" |
| e.g. / i.e. / etc. | for example / that is / (name the items) |
| gracefully handles | (say what it does: "retries three times, then stops") |
| out of the box | by default |
| under the hood | internally |
| blazingly fast, state-of-the-art | fast (give the number) / (delete) |
| streamline | make simpler, make faster |
| plethora, myriad | many |
| addresses the issue, tackles | corrects the fault, removes the error |

### Consistency pass

Collapse synonym rotations to one term each (Rules 1.11, 9.4). The two lists below work differently.

**Technical nouns — not in the dictionary. Pick one and keep it consistent (both modes):**

- config / configuration / settings / options → pick one

**Dictionary rulings — the standard has already chosen. Use the approved word (strict mode); pick one and keep it consistent (pragmatic mode):**

| You wrote | Dictionary status | Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| check (verb) / verify / confirm / ensure | All rejected as verbs | `make sure that` (strict); pick one (pragmatic) |
| validate | Not in dictionary | Use as technical verb (Rule 1.12), or replace with `make sure that` |
| delete / drop (verb) / destroy | All rejected | `erase` (data), `remove` (physical); avoid `drop` and `destroy` |
| remove | Approved verb | Keep it |
| run / execute | Both rejected | `operate` for run, `do` for execute (strict); pick one (pragmatic) |
| invoke / launch | Not in dictionary | Use as technical verbs (Rule 1.12) |
| display (verb) / render / present (verb) | All rejected | `show` (approved verb) |
| issue | Not in dictionary | Use as technical noun, or replace with `problem` (approved) |
| failure | Rejected in general use; approved as TN for performance loss | Use only when it means a performance error: "a failure of the pump" |
| error | Approved noun | Keep it |
| problem | Approved noun | Keep it |
