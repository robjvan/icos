### index.md Template

The index is sectioned by type. Each entry is one line: wikilink + summary.

```markdown
# Wiki Index

> Content catalog. Every wiki page listed under its type with a one-line summary.
> Read this first to find relevant pages for any query.
> Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD | Total pages: N

## Entities
<!-- Alphabetical within section -->

## Concepts

## Comparisons

## Queries
```

**Scaling rule:** When any section exceeds 50 entries, split it into sub-sections
by first letter or sub-domain. When the index exceeds 200 entries total, create
a `_meta/topic-map.md` that groups pages by theme for faster navigation.

### log.md Template

```markdown
# Wiki Log

> Chronological record of all wiki actions. Append-only.
> Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] action | subject`
> Actions: ingest, update, query, lint, create, archive, delete
> When this file exceeds 500 entries, rotate: rename to log-YYYY.md, start fresh.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] create | Wiki initialized
- Domain: [domain]
- Structure created with SCHEMA.md, index.md, log.md
```
