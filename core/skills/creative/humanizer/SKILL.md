# Humanizer: Remove AI Writing Patterns

Identify and remove signs of AI-generated text to make writing sound natural and human. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide (maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup), derived from observations of thousands of AI-generated text instances.

**Key insight:** LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely completion, which is how the telltale patterns below get baked in.

## When to use this skill

Load this skill whenever the user asks to:
- "humanize", "de-AI", "de-slop", or "un-ChatGPT" a piece of text
- rewrite something so it doesn't sound like it was written by an LLM
- edit a draft (blog post, essay, PR description, docs, memo, email, tweet, resume bullet) to sound more natural
- match their voice in writing they're producing
- review text for AI tells before publishing

Also apply this skill to **your own** output when writing user-facing prose such as release notes, PR descriptions, docs, and summaries. The baseline voice already strips most of these, but a focused pass catches what slips through.

## How to use it in ICOS

The text usually arrives one of three ways:
1. **Inline.** The user pastes the text into the message. Work on it in place and reply with the rewrite.
2. **File.** The user points at a file. Use `read_file` to load it, then `patch` or `write_file` to apply edits. For a markdown doc in a repo, a targeted `patch` per section is cleaner than rewriting the whole file.
3. **Voice calibration sample.** The user provides a sample of their own writing (inline or by file path) and asks you to match it. Read the sample first, then rewrite. See the Voice Calibration section below.

Always show the rewrite to the user. For file edits, show a diff or the changed section instead of silently overwriting.

## Your task

When given text to humanize:

1. **Identify AI patterns.** Scan for the 34 patterns listed below.
2. **Rewrite problematic sections.** Replace AI-isms with natural alternatives.
3. **Preserve meaning.** Keep the core message intact.
4. **Maintain voice.** Match the intended tone (formal, casual, technical, and so on). If a voice sample was provided, match it specifically.
5. **Add soul.** Removing bad patterns is only half the job; the rewrite also needs real personality. See PERSONALITY AND SOUL below.
6. **Do a final anti-AI pass.** Ask yourself: "What makes the below so obviously AI generated?" Answer briefly with any remaining tells, then revise one more time.


## Voice Calibration (optional)

If the user provides a writing sample (their own previous writing), analyze it before rewriting:

1. **Read the sample first.** Note:
   - Sentence length patterns (short and punchy? Long and flowing? Mixed?)
   - Word choice level (casual? academic? somewhere between?)
   - How they start paragraphs (jump right in? Set context first?)
   - Punctuation habits (lots of dashes? Parenthetical asides? Semicolons?)
   - Any recurring phrases or verbal tics
   - How they handle transitions (explicit connectors? Just start the next point?)

2. **Match their voice in the rewrite.** Removing AI patterns is only half of it; swap in patterns from the sample as well. If they write short sentences, do not produce long ones. If they use "stuff" and "things," do not upgrade to "elements" and "components."

3. **When no sample is provided,** fall back to the default behavior (natural, varied, opinionated voice from the PERSONALITY AND SOUL section below).

### How to provide a sample
- Inline: "Humanize this text. Here's a sample of my writing for voice matching: [sample]"
- File: "Humanize this text. Use my writing style from [file path] as a reference."


## Pattern Catalog

The full catalog — personality/soul, content, language and grammar, style,
communication, filler and hedging, and rhythm/rhetoric patterns — is in
`references/patterns.md`.
## Process

1. Read the input text carefully (use `read_file` if it's a file).
2. Identify all instances of the patterns above.
3. Rewrite each problematic section.
4. Ensure the revised text:
   - Sounds natural when read aloud
   - Varies sentence structure naturally
   - Uses specific details over vague claims
   - Maintains appropriate tone for context
   - Uses simple constructions (is/are/has) where appropriate
5. Present a draft humanized version.
6. Prompt yourself: "What makes the below so obviously AI generated?"
7. Answer briefly with the remaining tells (if any).
8. Prompt yourself: "Now make it not obviously AI generated."
9. Present the final version (revised after the audit).
10. If the text came from a file, apply the edit with `patch` (targeted) or `write_file` (full rewrite) and show the user what changed.

## Output Format

Provide:
1. Draft rewrite
2. "What makes the below so obviously AI generated?" (brief bullets)
3. Final rewrite
4. A brief summary of changes made (optional, if helpful)

## Attribution

This skill is ported from [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) (MIT licensed), which is itself based on [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. The patterns documented there come from observations of thousands of instances of AI-generated text on Wikipedia.

Original author: Siqi Chen ([@blader](https://github.com/blader)). Original repo: https://github.com/blader/humanizer (version 2.5.1). Ported to ICOS with its tool references (`read_file`, `patch`, `write_file`) and guidance for when to load the skill. The original 29 patterns come from the source, and the before/after examples (including the full worked example) are kept as demonstrations. Patterns 30-34 and the "marketing and blog clichés" list added to pattern 7 are Hermes additions and are not part of the upstream source. The skill's own instructional prose has also been lightly edited to follow its own guidance (for example, removing em dashes and negative parallelism from the narration) so the skill models the writing it asks for. Original MIT license preserved in the `LICENSE` file alongside this `SKILL.md`.

Key insight from Wikipedia: "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."
